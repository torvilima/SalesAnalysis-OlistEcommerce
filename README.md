# SalesAnalysis-OlistEcommerce
Data Analysis/Visualization using Python and Power BI

This project used a free data source provided by Olist that you can find on Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

This directory contains 3 files:

1 DOCX with Analyst comments about results

1 PowerBI file that contains dashboards (due Free Version I can't publish online)

1 Python/JupiterNotebook file that you can read here or use a JupiterNotebook or Visual Studio Code

The datasets from data sources were too big to upload, so you can find to download them on the link above.
